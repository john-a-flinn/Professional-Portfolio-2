        <h1>Personal Experience with AI in Software Engineering</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming education by providing tools that enhance learning, streamline problem-solving, and foster creativity. In Software Engineering, AI plays a crucial role in reducing barriers to understanding complex concepts and accelerating development workflows. Specifically, in my experience and in courses like ICS 314, AI has been instrumental in coding and problem-solving tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Experience with AI</h2>
        <p>
            For the experience WODs, since there wasn’t a limit to the number of attempts, I would first try to solve the WOD with little to no AI assistance. If I encountered something I didn’t understand, I would use AI to help me figure it out. During these WODs, I primarily focused on fixing syntax errors in my code and learning from my mistakes. If I failed, I used AI to generate solutions and compared them to my initial attempt to understand where I went wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            For in-class practice WODs with time limits, I used AI to quickly generate solutions by providing assignment details. I often formatted, completed text blocks, or inserted images as needed. For final projects, I relied on AI for formatting pages, adding functionality, and debugging. By iteratively using AI to explain unfamiliar concepts or print debugging statements, I solved complex problems more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI was particularly useful for learning. When I encountered code I didn’t understand, I asked AI for explanations or simplified versions. For quality assurance, I used AI to identify and fix ESLint errors or reformat code to meet coding standards.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            AI has had both positive and negative effects on my learning experience. On the downside, it has made it harder for me to master syntax and improve my ability to read code effectively. For example, during FreeCodeCamp lessons, I avoided AI unless I was stuck for over 30 minutes. However, AI has significantly sped up the coding process, allowing me to focus on logic and problem-solving instead of manual typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI has also deepened my understanding of coding concepts. By asking AI to explain complex functions, parameters, and their applications, I developed a more analytical approach to coding.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond ICS 314, AI has practical uses in real-world scenarios like hackathons or collaborative projects. For instance, AI can assist with debugging, prototyping, or quickly formatting code. While AI efficiently handles simple coding tasks, it cannot replace human creativity or problem-solving, especially when unique project requirements arise.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            Some challenges I encountered include AI's inability to fix logic errors effectively or handle ESLint standards perfectly. Additionally, AI often outputs incomplete responses for long explanations and uses inconsistent code formatting. These limitations highlight opportunities for AI to improve in detecting logic issues, producing clean code, and integrating with industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In education, over-reliance on AI can stunt foundational skill development, particularly in understanding syntax and reading large codebases. Educators can address this challenge by encouraging responsible AI usage while emphasizing conceptual learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional teaching methods focus on building a solid foundation in concepts, syntax, and logical reasoning. While this approach fosters deep comprehension and knowledge retention, it can be time-consuming. AI, on the other hand, accelerates repetitive tasks like debugging and formatting, freeing up time for higher-level problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, AI can become a crutch if overused, preventing students from developing critical thinking skills. A balanced approach—using AI as a supportive tool while reinforcing independent problem-solving—maximizes the benefits of both traditional and AI-enhanced learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            In the future, AI will likely improve its ability to solve higher-level problems and detect logic errors. This advancement poses challenges for educators to design assignments that test understanding rather than rely on AI-generated solutions. Projects emphasizing creativity, collaboration, and unique constraints can ensure AI remains a tool rather than a shortcut.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance the learning process when used responsibly. It accelerates coding tasks, clarifies concepts, and provides valuable feedback. However, over-reliance on AI can hinder the development of foundational skills like syntax comprehension and logical reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
            To optimize AI integration in software engineering courses, educators should balance traditional methods with AI-enhanced approaches. Encouraging students to use AI for efficiency while fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills will ensure AI remains a supportive tool in learning.
