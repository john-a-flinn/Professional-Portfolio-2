        <h1>Personal Experience with AI in Software Engineering</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming education by providing tools that enhance learning, streamline problem-solving, and foster creativity. In Software Engineering, AI plays a crucial role in reducing barriers to understanding complex concepts and accelerating development workflows. Specifically, in my experience and in courses like ICS 314, AI has been instrumental in coding and problem-solving tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Experience with AI</h2>
        <p>
            For the experience WODs, since there wasn’t a limit to the number of attempts, I would first try to solve the WOD with little to no AI assistance. If I encountered something I didn’t understand, I would use AI to help me figure it out. Since most of these experience WODs happened at the start of the year, I mostly used the first attempt to fix syntax errors in my code. If I failed on the first try, I would then use AI, copy the question, and ask for a solution in the relevant programming language. If that solution worked and I finished the WOD on time, I would compare the first attempt to the second by copying my first try and asking AI to explain what I did wrong. Lastly, if I couldn’t solve the problem even with AI, I would watch the instructor's video while using AI to clarify any unclear explanations. I would take screenshots of the changes shown in the video and type out what the instructor said.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the in-class practice WODs, which had a time limit, I would copy all the relevant information from the assignment and then use ChatGPT to generate the code. Depending on the result, I sometimes needed to format the code, finish incomplete text blocks, or insert images.
        </p>
        <p>
            The actual WODs were similar to the practice ones, but I used the same question chain strategy. I provided the relevant assignment details, and if there was an image tied to it (like a website design), I included the image in the file. Then, I would insert the code AI provided into my file and handle any necessary formatting, completing text blocks, or inserting images. It didn’t take much time since it only required reading a couple hundred lines of code. Occasionally, the AI would also add helpful comments explaining the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            For essays, I would write them myself based on my experience and then use AI to check grammar and spelling. I iterated on the AI's suggestions until the essay was both grammatically correct and maintained the spirit of the original writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the final project I would either use AI for formatting a page, adding functionality, and debugging. For formatting a page I would find a website that had an image I liked then I would have AI making it according to the image I gave it. This would give me a basic outline of what I wanted. Then I would using AI to give it parts of what I would like to be add and have it print the whole code as a new one. Then I would copy and paste and check github desktop for the changes and where they were in the code. Then if they looked good I would publish and push the changes. For debugging I would ask to add prints to the website then keep iterating more prints until I figured out where the bug was. For example when trying to make a submit function work I used AI to add print to all the options until I realized there was a button I didn’t know about that came from a teamtate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For learning, I would input code I didn’t understand and ask AI for an explanation. If the explanation was still unclear, I would ask for a simpler version or request links to websites with answers I could better understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            To answer questions, I used ChatGPT to generate responses to professor questions and compared them to my classmates' answers. I never had to ask questions in the "smart-question" channel because ChatGPT typically gave me the answers beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of debugging (expanding on point 5) was when I typed, “Search for a variable called material” that was preventing me from submitting my code. Expanding on point 9, the AI initially gave me answers that didn’t make sense until I rephrased the question. Eventually, it identified that a button was creating the variable, and I needed to check if a different button was being pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For writing code, AI was really helpful when I provided a specific goal and had it generate the solution. I would then check GitHub to review the changes and ensure they were correct. Occasionally, I would delete unnecessary parts of the AI-generated code, such as placeholder product lists for my final project.
        </p>
        <p>
            For documentation, I preferred to write it myself to ensure I understood the code and that the AI-generated code was correct. If I didn’t understand something, I would ask AI to explain specific lines of code in the same conversation thread.
        </p>
        <p>
            For quality assurance, I would take a screenshot of the ESLint error and ask AI for a solution or have it reformat the code to resolve issues like the 120-character line limit.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            AI has had both positive and negative effects on my learning experience. On the downside, it has made it harder for me to master syntax and improve my ability to read code effectively. For example, during FreeCodeCamp lessons, I avoided AI unless I was stuck for over 30 minutes. However, AI has significantly sped up the coding process, allowing me to focus on logic and problem-solving instead of manual typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI has also deepened my understanding of coding concepts. By asking AI to explain complex functions, parameters, and their applications, I developed a more analytical approach to coding.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond ICS 314, AI has practical uses in real-world scenarios like hackathons or collaborative projects. For instance, AI can assist with debugging, prototyping, or quickly formatting code. While AI efficiently handles simple coding tasks, it cannot replace human creativity or problem-solving, especially when unique project requirements arise.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            Some challenges I encountered include AI's inability to fix logic errors effectively or handle ESLint standards perfectly. Additionally, AI often outputs incomplete responses for long explanations and uses inconsistent code formatting. These limitations highlight opportunities for AI to improve in detecting logic issues, producing clean code, and integrating with industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In education, over-reliance on AI can stunt foundational skill development, particularly in understanding syntax and reading large codebases. Educators can address this challenge by encouraging responsible AI usage while emphasizing conceptual learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional teaching methods focus on building a solid foundation in concepts, syntax, and logical reasoning. While this approach fosters deep comprehension and knowledge retention, it can be time-consuming. AI, on the other hand, accelerates repetitive tasks like debugging and formatting, freeing up time for higher-level problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, AI can become a crutch if overused, preventing students from developing critical thinking skills. A balanced approach—using AI as a supportive tool while reinforcing independent problem-solving—maximizes the benefits of both traditional and AI-enhanced learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            In the future, AI will likely improve its ability to solve higher-level problems and detect logic errors. This advancement poses challenges for educators to design assignments that test understanding rather than rely on AI-generated solutions. Projects emphasizing creativity, collaboration, and unique constraints can ensure AI remains a tool rather than a shortcut.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            AI is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance the learning process when used responsibly. It accelerates coding tasks, clarifies concepts, and provides valuable feedback. However, over-reliance on AI can hinder the development of foundational skills like syntax comprehension and logical reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
            To optimize AI integration in software engineering courses, educators should balance traditional methods with AI-enhanced approaches. Encouraging students to use AI for efficiency while fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills will ensure AI remains a supportive tool in learning.
