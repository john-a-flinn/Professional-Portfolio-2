The first thing I noticed about the ESLint coding standards is that 
using two spaces for indentation is really frustrating, as I'm used to pressing 
the tab key. It also makes the indentation less clear at a glance. Additionally, 
dealing with trailing spaces at the end of a line, even after a semicolon or a comment, 
feels pointless and tedious to fix. Apart from these issues, the only other errors I’ve 
encountered were related to the improper setup of the TypeScript configuration, which isn’t 
part of the coding standards. I would say that I'm pretty good at basic coding standards since 
the previous college I attended would grade very harshly on not following coding standards.
