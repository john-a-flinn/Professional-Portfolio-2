The first time I ever coded was for a game called Counter-Strike. 
I was around 12 years old and wanted to save all my settings for the game, but I had no idea how to do it. After discovering a video tutorial, 
I spent nearly 10 hours watching it repeatedly, struggling to understand the steps. It was frustrating at times, but once I finally got it working, the sense of accomplishment felt amazing.

In high school, I decided to take a coding class, thinking it might help me explore programming further. 
Unfortunately, I ended up disliking it because the class only focused on syntax, and there wasn’t any emphasis on the logic or creativity behind coding. 
It felt like learning a language without understanding how to actually use it.

A year into college, I started talking with some friends who had graduated with degrees in computer science. 
They encouraged me to give coding another shot, assuring me that real programming was nothing like the dry, uninspiring class I had taken in high school. 
They explained that coding was much more about problem-solving and creativity than just following rigid rules.

That advice resonated with me, and I began to see programming in a new light. 
What I really enjoy about it now is the creative freedom it offers—there are often many ways to solve the same problem.
I love that there's no "error" in the field itself because everything that goes wrong can be traced back to the code. 
It’s all in the hands of the programmer, which makes the challenge even more rewarding.
