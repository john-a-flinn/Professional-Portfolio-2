The first thing I noticed about TypeScript was that you don’t need to declare each data type, and arrays can have any data type, which is a lot like Python.
The next thing was that there is no need for main, which is different from C and Java.
The way TypeScript handles equality is different; for example, instead of calling .equals(), in TypeScript, you can use ===.
Besides that, most of the syntax is the same as C and Java, such as using semicolons at the end of a line and the way loops are written.
I think TypeScript is a lot like Python in how streamlined it is, though it’s not as streamlined as Python.
There are annoying things like declaring variables, using semicolons, and the print statement, which aren’t as quick as in Python.
To me, it seems like a mix of more traditional languages like C and Java and more modern ones like Python. However, the problem with that is it can get confusing to know which syntax to use because it’s mixed.

I’m not a fan of athletic software engineering. To me, the timer stresses me out and distracts me, as I need to keep track of the time.
I have been able to complete the WODs within the Rx time on the first attempt, but I can see that as they get harder and I’m unable to maintain that pace, it could mess with my flow.
For me, it’s hard to stay in the flow for an extended time, and when I work, I take constant breaks, which I’m unable to do when there’s a time crunch. So, I don’t think it will work for me, but I’m willing to give it my best effort.
